# React JS Landing Page Template

\*\*

# 🛎️🛎️ Good news! New & improved [V2](https://github.com/issaafalkattan/react-landing-page-template-2021) is out

\*\*

### <a href="https://react-landing-page-template-93ne.vercel.app/">LIVE DEMO</a>

## Description

This is a ReactJS based landing page template, fit for a startup company/service with a one page view. The design is inspired by a template from <a href="https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/preview/page234/interact/">Free-CSS.com </a>
All 'visual' data can be easily modified by changing the data.json file.

## Make it Yours!

### 1. Preps

You will need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node JS</a> installed on your pc.

### 2. Clone Files

After cloning the files, you will have to run `yarn` followed by `yarn start` in the CLI

### 3. Add your own data

Change the data in the `data.json` file as well as add any images to `public/img/`
You can also change styles by modifying the `public/css` files.
If you need the contact form to work, you also need to create an EmailJS account, and modify the `src/components/contact.jsx` file to replace your own service ID, template ID and Public Key
